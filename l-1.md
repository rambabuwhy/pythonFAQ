# L\[::-1]

In Python, `L[::-1]` is a slicing technique used on a sequence, such as a list (`L` in this case). This particular slicing syntax is used to reverse the order of elements in the sequence.

Here's a breakdown of the slicing syntax:

* The first colon `:` represents the starting index of the slice.
* The second colon `:` represents the ending index of the slice.
* The absence of a starting index before the first colon implies that it starts from the beginning of the sequence.
* The absence of an ending index after the second colon implies that it goes up to the end of the sequence.
* The `-1` as a step size indicates that it traverses the sequence in reverse.

So, `L[::-1]` essentially means "start from the end and move backwards, taking all elements." This results in the reversal of the original sequence `L`.
