# Monkey patching

Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of modifying or extending code at runtime, typically during the execution of a program. This is achieved by replacing, modifying, or adding new functionality to classes, modules, or functions without altering their original source code.

Monkey patching can be useful in situations where you don't have direct control over the source code or when you need to quickly fix a bug or add a feature without waiting for an official update. However, it should be used with caution as it can lead to unexpected behavior and make code harder to understand and maintain.

Here's a simple example of monkey patching in Python:

```python
# Original class definition
class MyClass:
    def method(self):
        return "Original method"

# Monkey patching: defining a new method for MyClass
def new_method(self):
    return "Patched method"

MyClass.method = new_method

# Creating an instance of MyClass
obj = MyClass()

# Calling the patched method
print(obj.method())  # Output: Patched method
```

In this example, we define a class `MyClass` with a method `method()`. Then, we define a new function `new_method()` and assign it as the `method` attribute of the `MyClass` class, effectively replacing the original method. When we create an instance of `MyClass` and call the `method()` on the instance, it executes the patched method instead of the original one.

However, monkey patching can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in large codebases or when multiple developers are involved. It's generally considered a last resort solution and should be used judiciously. When possible, it's better to use more standard techniques such as subclassing, composition, or explicit dependency injection.
