# Generator functions

In Python, `yield` is a keyword used in the context of generator functions. Generator functions are special functions that enable you to define an iterator in a more concise and elegant way compared to traditional iterator classes. When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator called a generator.

The `yield` statement is used within a generator function to produce a series of values one at a time, rather than returning them all at once. When the `yield` statement is encountered in a function, the function's state is frozen, and the value specified by `yield` is returned to the caller. The state of the function is then resumed from where it left off the next time the function is called.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the use of `yield` in Python:

```python
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

# Using the generator
gen = my_generator()

print(next(gen))  # Output: 1
print(next(gen))  # Output: 2
print(next(gen))  # Output: 3
# print(next(gen))  # This would raise a StopIteration exception because the generator has no more values to yield
```

In this example, `my_generator()` is a generator function that yields three values: 1, 2, and 3. Each time `next()` is called on the generator object `gen`, it advances to the next `yield` statement and returns the value specified by `yield`. Once there are no more `yield` statements to execute, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, indicating that the generator has no more values to yield.

Generators are particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when you need to lazily generate values, as they allow you to generate values on-the-fly rather than storing them all in memory at once.
